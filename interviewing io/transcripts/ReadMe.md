How to train myself as a best interviewer? I have no idea more than two years ago. After working on interiviewing.io two years as an interviewer, I like to learn from my own experience. One is to dive deep, look into those transcripts. <br>

I like to find all possible problems through those transcripts. Since replaying those videos take time, I like to work on transcript first. <br>

It is not easy for me to work on communication. I notice that my thinking process is different, people have to adjust to my style. I should look into the issue as well.
