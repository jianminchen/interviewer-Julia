It is the most rewarding job to be an interviewer. I like to document my growth as an interviewer of data structure and algorithm, system design. I like to document each mock interview, what I learn, what I share, and what I work on.

I did work as an interviewer on interviewing.io since Jan. 2018, I have over 130 interviews as a mock interviewer. I like to list the algorithm I asked in each interview. 

It will take me some time to review all algorithms I asked. But I like to learn from my experience.
